## Overriding packages
Not too sure how you want to approach this. It might be better to simply allocate more time for setting up the project -> so let part 1 encompass both exercise sessions.

Otherwise to have them override platform packages will require them to have access to the ethiopia-on-platform private repo and adding everyone as a viewer/contributor to that repo might take long.

An alternative is to just demo the way package overrides happen -> so opening the Dockerfile and go scripts and explain how it works. 

I'd recommend giving extra time, and less aid, during part 1 instead and forgo part 2 altogether.
